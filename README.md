Diabetes Prediction EDA and Modeling
Dataset Overview
The dataset contains various health-related features and an 'Outcome' variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

Features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) - whether the patient has diabetes
Initial checks showed no missing values, but zero values in Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI were treated as missing and imputed with the median.
